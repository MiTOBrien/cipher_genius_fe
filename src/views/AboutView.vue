    <p>
      Classical ciphers, or cryptography, has existed for thousands of years, and it wasn't until
      the early 20th century that more complex mechanical and electromechanical machines such as the
      Enigma rotor machine were invented and advanced crytography as we know it.

    <h3 class="heading">Caesar Cipher</h3>
    <p>
      The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where letters are shifted and subsituted to
      encrypt the message and was used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military
      significance. He supposedly used a standard shift of 3 letters for his communications and his
      new nephew, Augustus, also used this cipher method with a standard shift of 1 letter.
